Cultivating Trust. One auction at a time.

Built on Flow, and leveraging Privy for seamless onboarding and Worldcoin for robust seller verification, AgriCult provides an on-chain Dutch auction platform for verified organic goods, fostering direct, transparent trade and community resiliency.

# ü§ù Why our project matters

As digital nomads, we seek to genuinely engage with the places we visit. 
Our project provides travelers and the communities they reside in the opportunity to contribute to the local economy by supporting the organic producers who represent an integral part of the regional food system. Current systems disconnect producers from buyers, making it hard for conscious consumers to truly support local economies. Despite their dedication to sustainable practices, their livelihoods are constantly threatened by significant cuts taken by middlemen and volatile commodity prices.
